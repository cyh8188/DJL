# Quick start

Deep Java Library (DJL) is designed to be easy to get started with and simple to use.
The easiest way to learn DJL is to read the [beginner tutorial](../jupyter/tutorial) or our [examples](../examples).

## Prerequisites

* You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. We recommend using JDK 8, but any later version also works. For more information, see [Setup](development/setup.md).
* You need git installed on your system to clone the DJL repository.

## Get source code

We try our best to maintain a stable master branch. If you experience issues with the master branch, use the latest 
[stable release](https://github.com/awslabs/djl/releases/latest).

## Beginner tutorial

To get started, we recommed that you follow our short [beginner tutorial](../jupyter/tutorial). It takes you through some of the basics of deep learning to create a model, train your model, and run inference using your trained model.

## Run examples

DJL also provides examples for both training and performing inference with deep learning models. You can find the examples and their source code in the [examples](../examples) directory.
 
All of our examples are executed by a simple command. For detailed command line instructions, see each exampleâ€™s Readme.md file.
