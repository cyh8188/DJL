/**
 * This is a wrapper over the model files from different sources, e.g. gpt2.pt, gpt2.onnx, etc. This
 * interface is an abstraction of the causal language model, which in essence is a conditional
 * probability function: p_\theta(v_t | x_{< t})}, v_t \in V, i.e. given the past tokens up to a
 * certain time x_{< t}, the probability that the next token is v, taken from a vocabulary set V.
 * \theta is the model's weight. This function can take an input sequence `inputIds`, whose length
 * can be greater than one. In this case, the output is still p_\theta(v_i | x_{< i})}, i in
 * range(|inputIds|). This means for each i, the output probability is conditional on the past
 * sequence up to i.
